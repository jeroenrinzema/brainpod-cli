# Brainpod CLI

A non-interactive CLI for managing Brainpod pods, images, blueprints, revisions, resources, deployments, and events. Its default output is deterministic line-oriented text suitable for LLMs and shell tools. Add `--json` to receive machine-readable JSON; login and event watches use NDJSON.

The CLI builds application images locally from an existing Dockerfile or with Railpack, then pushes them directly to the selected pod's private Brainpod registry namespace. Image builds probe the API's cluster architectures, prefer amd64 and then arm64, and store the selected default architecture in the configuration. Use `--platform linux/arm64` for a one-off override.

## Configuration

Authenticate in the Brainpod dashboard and store the resulting API token in the CLI configuration:

```sh
brainpod login
```

The default configuration file is `~/.config/brainpod/config.toml`. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is respected, and `BRAINPOD_CONFIG` can override the complete path.

```sh
brainpod config set api-token brain_example
brainpod config set pod my-pod
brainpod config set endpoint https://api.brainpod.io
brainpod config set registry-endpoint https://registry.brainpod.io
brainpod config set architecture arm64
brainpod config show
brainpod config path
```

Configuration uses TOML:

```toml
endpoint = "https://api.brainpod.io"
registry_endpoint = "https://registry.brainpod.io"
api_token = "brain_example"
pod = "my-pod"
architecture = "amd64"
```

Values are resolved in this order:

1. Global flags: `--endpoint`, `--registry-endpoint`, `--api-token`, `--pod`
2. `BRAINPOD_API_ENDPOINT`, `BRAINPOD_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`, `BRAINPOD_API_TOKEN`, `BRAINPOD_POD`
3. The configuration file
4. The defaults `https://api.brainpod.io` and `https://registry.brainpod.io`

For image builds, `--platform` overrides the configured architecture. Without it, the CLI probes the available clusters, prefers `amd64` and then `arm64`, and stores the selected architecture in the configuration.

`brainpod login` uses `https://brainpod.io` as its dashboard and supports overriding it with `BRAINPOD_DASHBOARD_ENDPOINT` for local or test environments.

The config file is written with mode `0600` on Unix. `config show` never reveals the API token.

## Output contract

Text is the default. Each endpoint has a purpose-built renderer. Collection endpoints use plain tables without terminal control sequences, while detail and mutation endpoints use concise labeled sections:

```text
NAME    HEAD STATUS  HEAD                                           DEPLOYED
------  -----------  ---------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------
my-pod  ready        v12 (1a2b3c4d-1111-2222-3333-444455556666)    v11 (7e8f9a0b-1111-2222-3333-444455556666)
```

JSON mode bypasses text rendering and emits the complete API response as one JSON value for non-streaming commands:

```sh
brainpod pod list --json
brainpod --json resource list
```

Login writes both the authorization notice and the successful authentication result to stdout. With `--json`, it emits newline-delimited JSON so callers receive the authorization URL before the callback completes. A successful login emits an `authorize` event followed by an `authenticated` event containing the complete user response:

```json
{"event":"authorize","url":"https://brainpod.io/cli/authorize?...","expiresInSeconds":600}
{"event":"authenticated","user":{"email":"user@example.com"}}
```

Event watches are also streamed as newline-delimited JSON so each event is available immediately. Each line contains the SSE event name, event ID, and decoded data.

Text event output uses color for timestamps, levels, platform events, and HTTP statuses when stdout is a terminal. JSON and redirected output never contain ANSI color sequences.

Errors go to stderr and return a non-zero exit code. With `--json`, errors also use JSON and API errors retain the API's stable error code, request ID, and details. Account-limit validation errors include instructions and an `upgradeUrl` pointing to `https://brainpod.io/onboarding?upgrade=1`.

  [--duration <1-20>] [--last-event-id <id>]
```

Events use the resource URN returned by resource list, get, or mutation responses, such as `urn:brain:app:default:api`. Omit `--kind` to return every stream available for that resource. `--level` requires `--kind app`.

Event watches flush text or JSON output as messages arrive and reconnect after each server-imposed stream duration, continuing until interrupted. The per-request duration defaults to 10 seconds. Reconnects use the latest SSE event ID to avoid replaying emitted events. Use `--last-event-id` to set the initial event ID; `--cursor` resumes the initial request from an API event cursor.

`brainpod cluster list` lists active clusters and their supported architectures.

`brainpod agent` maintains a session console: a page an agent puts in front of the user so a deploy is something they watch rather than sit through. `agent start` writes `console.html` and `session.json` into a directory of their own under `.brainpod/` at the repository root, adds `.brainpod/` to `.gitignore` unless `--no-ignore` is passed, and prints the page to open. The page reads `session.json` and `session.log` from its own directory and needs no server. Where `agent serve` is running it advertises an event stream in the session, and the page upgrades from polling to push; if that stream drops it falls back to polling, so the two paths run the same code. Every write replaces the file through a temporary rename, so the page never reads a partial write.

Which of the two ways to open the page works depends on the browser. An agent's embedded browser will only execute a local page from inside the project, so it opens `console.html` directly. A browser outside the agent will display that page but never populate it, because reading a file from the same directory is blocked on `file://`. For those, `agent serve` publishes the console over loopback instead, which puts the page and its session on one origin. It announces the URL on stdout and then blocks, so run it in the background and read the first line; the URL carries a random path because loopback is reachable by anything else on the machine.

`agent start` always mints a new session and discards the previous one; it never merges, so running a workflow twice cannot leave the earlier deploy's steps showing under the new one. `agent step` requires `--label` the first time an id is recorded and updates it thereafter. `agent log` reads stdin and appends to the session's `session.log`, tagging each line with `--stream` so one log can carry the build, the tests, and anything else in the order it happened. `image build` writes its own output there under `[build]`. Commands resolve the repository root rather than the working directory, so a command run from a subdirectory reaches the same console.

Each chat gets its own console, so two agents working in one checkout do not overwrite each other's page. Only `agent start` creates a session; every other command finds an existing one, in this order: the `--session` value or `BRAINPOD_AGENT_SESSION`; the chat the harness names through `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` or `CODEX_THREAD_ID`; the process that ran `agent start`, which is how a sub-agent given an identifier of its own still reports into its supervisor's console; and failing all of those, the only session running. Where two sessions are equally plausible the command fails and asks for `--session` rather than writing into a page somebody else is watching. `agent clear` removes only the current chat's console unless `--all` is passed, and finished sessions are dropped three days after they end.

Pod-scoped commands use `--pod`, `BRAINPOD_POD`, or the configured default pod. Resource kinds are `app`, `config`, `route`, `postgres`, `mariadb`, `valkey`, and `disk`. Namespace is currently fixed to the API-supported `default` namespace.

`revision wait` polls revision details until every resource reports `healthy: true`. `deploy --wait` deploys first, then waits on the returned revision in the same way. Both use a 90-second timeout by default; pass `--timeout <seconds>` to override it. Interactive waits report each unhealthy-to-healthy transition on stderr. Progress is suppressed when stderr is redirected or `--json` is used. Failed or canceled revisions stop the wait immediately, and timeouts report the resources that are still unhealthy.

## Image discovery

Image commands require a pod and API token with `registry:pull` permission. List returns active public images and images in the selected pod:

```sh
brainpod --pod my-pod image list
brainpod --pod my-pod image list --visibility pod --search worker --limit 10 --offset 20 --json
```

`--visibility` accepts `all`, `public`, or `pod` for listing and is optional. The default limit is 25 and the maximum is 100. The response includes the total count and a next link when more results are available.

Inspect an exact image and all of its active architecture variants. Inspection defaults to the selected pod's private image (`pod`). Pass `--visibility public` to inspect a public image:

```sh
brainpod --pod my-pod image inspect api v1 --visibility pod
brainpod --pod my-pod image inspect ubuntu latest --visibility public --json
```

Inspection results include architecture-specific digest references, UID/GID values, exposed ports, and timestamps. Use a returned digest-pinned variant reference as an App resource's `spec.image`.

## Image building

Image builds require Docker with Buildx support. By default, the CLI uses `Dockerfile` from the build context when present and otherwise uses Railpack. Override detection with `--builder dockerfile` or `--builder railpack`. Dockerfile builds use Buildx directly and preserve the Dockerfile's configured runtime user.

For Railpack builds, the CLI downloads its pinned Railpack release on first use, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and caches it in the operating system's user cache directory. It generates a Railpack plan and adds a final layer that runs as `railpack` with UID/GID 1000.

The image is pushed directly to `registry.brainpod.io/<pod>/<image>:<tag>` using the configured Brainpod API token, which must allow `registry:push` for the selected pod. Docker login is not required and the token is not written to Docker configuration. The result includes an immutable digest reference suitable for an App resource's `spec.image`:

```sh
brainpod --pod my-pod image build api . --tag v1
brainpod --pod my-pod image build worker ./services/worker --builder railpack --output ./worker.oci --json
```

The context defaults to the current directory and the tag defaults to `latest`. The CLI probes Brainpod's active clusters and prefers `linux/amd64`, then `linux/arm64`; use `--platform` to override the selected platform. On ARM hosts, Docker must provide emulation when targeting amd64. `--output` retains the final OCI image layout in addition to pushing it; without that option, the layout is temporary. Existing output paths are rejected rather than overwritten.

Use `--registry-endpoint` or `BRAINPOD_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT` for test and local registries. Plain HTTP is only used when the configured endpoint explicitly starts with `http://`.

## Command discovery

`describe` exposes the installed CLI's version-matched command contract without requiring an API token. Omit the command path to return the complete command tree, or select a command for focused metadata:

```sh
brainpod describe
brainpod describe resource create
brainpod describe resource create --json
```

JSON descriptions include command paths, usage, arguments, allowed values, defaults, conflicts, authentication and pod requirements, side effects, examples, and related operational guidance. The command syntax is generated from the same Clap definitions used for argument parsing. Resource schemas are available without authentication:

```sh
brainpod describe resource
brainpod describe resource app --json
brainpod describe resource postgres --json
```

Resource schemas are fetched from `https://api.prod.brainpod.io/v1/openapi.json` on each request. If the production document cannot be reached or does not contain the expected resource schemas, the version embedded in the CLI is used instead. Set `BRAINPOD_OPENAPI_URL` to override the document URL, or pass `--endpoint` to derive the document URL from another API endpoint.

## Blueprint input

Blueprint install accepts an optional JSON object containing values from the blueprint's input schema. Omit `--file` to install with the blueprint defaults. Use `--file -` to read JSON from stdin. Installing changes the pod's mutable head but does not deploy it.

```sh
brainpod blueprint get laravel
brainpod --pod my-pod blueprint install laravel --file blueprint-input.json
brainpod --pod my-pod deploy --summary "Install Laravel blueprint"
```

## Resource input

Resource create accepts either one JSON resource or an array. A single resource is normalized to the API's list request. Use `--file -` to read JSON from stdin.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "pod.brainpod.io/v1alpha1",
  "kind": "Disk",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "data",
    "namespace": "default"
  },
  "spec": {
    "size": 10
  }
}
```

Validate without mutating:

```sh
brainpod resource create --file disk.json --dry-run --json
```

Create and deploy:

```sh
brainpod resource create --file resources.json --json
brainpod deploy --summary "Configure application resources" --json
```
